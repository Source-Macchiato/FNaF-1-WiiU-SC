    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwo": "Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So,",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linethree": "I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linefour": "Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week, okay?",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linefive": "Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linesix": "Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, \"Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.lineseven": "A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.lineheight": "Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linenine": "Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon",
    "nightone.phoneguy.lineten": "property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.\"",
    "nightone.phoneguy.lineeleven": "Blah, blah, blah. Now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwelve": "Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linethirteen": "If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath?",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linefourteen": "I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linefifteen": "special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linesixteen": "So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of",
    "nightone.phoneguy.lineseventeen": "free roaming mode at night. Uh... something about their servos locking up",
    "nightone.phoneguy.lineeighteen": "if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linenineteen": "But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwenty": "Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any,",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyone": "is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwentytwo": "They'll pr- they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwentythree": "Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyfour": "forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyfive": "if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices,",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwentysix": "especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyseven": "forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort... and death.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyheight": "Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linetwentynine": "and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linethirty": "Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze.",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linethirtyone": "I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors",
    "nightone.phoneguy.linethirtytwo": "only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.lineone": "Uhh, Hello? Hello? Uh, well, if you're hearing this and you made it to day two, uh, congrats!",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linetwo": "I-I won't talk quite as long this time since Freddy and his friends tend to become more active as the week progresses.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linethree": "Uhh, it might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linefour": "just to make sure everyone's in their proper place. You know...",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linefive": "Uh... interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn't come off stage very often.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linesix": "I heard he becomes a lot more active in the dark though, so, hey,",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.lineseven": "I guess that's one more reason not to run out of power, right?",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.lineheight": "I-I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door lights.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linenine": "There are blind spots in your camera views, and those blind spots happen to be right outside of your doors.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.lineten": "So if-if you can't find something, or someone, on your cameras, be sure to check the door lights.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.lineeleven": "Uh, you might only have a few seconds to react... Uh, not that you would be in any danger, of course.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linetwelve": "I'm not implying that. Also, check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linethirteen": "The character in there seems unique in that he becomes more active if the cameras remain off for long periods of time.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linefourteen": "I guess he doesn't like being watched. I don't know.",
    "nighttwo.phoneguy.linefifteen": "Anyway, I'm sure you have everything under control! Uh, talk to you soon.",
    "nighthree.phoneguy.lineone": "Hello, hello? Hey you're doing great! Most people don't last this long.",
    "nighthree.phoneguy.linetwo": "I mean, you know, they usually move on to other things by now. I'm not implying that they died.",
    "nighthree.phoneguy.linethree": "Th-th-that's not what I meant. Uh, anyway I better not take up too much of your time.",
    "nighthree.phoneguy.linefour": "Things start getting real tonight. Uh... hey, listen, I had an idea: if you happen to get caught",
    "nighthree.phoneguy.linefive": "and want to avoid getting stuffed into a Freddy suit, uhh, try playing dead! You know, go limp.",
    "nighthree.phoneguy.linesix": "Then there's a chance that, uh, maybe they'll think that you're an empty costume instead.",
    "nighthree.phoneguy.lineseven": "Then again, if they think you're an empty costume, they might try to... stuff a metal skeleton into you.",
    "nighthree.phoneguy.lineheight": "I wonder how that would work. Yeah, never mind, scratch that. It's best just not to get caught.",
    "nighthree.phoneguy.linenine": "Um... okay, I'll leave you to it. See you on the flip side!",
    "nightfour.phoneguy.lineone": "Hello, hello? Hey! Hey, wow, day 4. I knew you could do it. Uh, hey, listen,",
    "nightfour.phoneguy.linetwo": "I may not be around to send you a message tomorrow. *banging* It's-It's been a bad night here for me.",
    "nightfour.phoneguy.linethree": "Um, I-I'm kinda glad that I recorded my messages for you *clears throat* uh, when I did.",
    "nightfour.phoneguy.linefour": "Uh, hey, do me a favor. *banging* Maybe sometime, uh, you could check inside those suits in the back room?",
    "nightfour.phoneguy.linefive": "*banging* I'm gonna to try to hold out until someone checks. Maybe it won't be so bad.",
    "nightfour.phoneguy.linesix": "*bang bang* Uh, I-I-I-I always wondered what was in all those empty heads back there. *chime plays*.",
    "nightfour.phoneguy.lineseven": "You know... *deep moan* oh, no - *noises followed by a loud screech and static*",
    "nightfive.phoneguy.lineone": "seldom knows contemporaneous (Omitted: reward; it is enough to possess) the joy of creative (Omitted: service.)",
    "nightfive.phoneguy.linetwo": "Countless uses (Omitted: of Bose instruments) will be made by future gener- (Omitted: ations. The scientist)",
    "nightfive.phoneguy.linethree": "to indicate the influence of various types of fertilizers on plant growth? You are right.",
    "nightfive.phoneguy.linefour": "Would it not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory experiments",
    "nightfive.phoneguy.linefive": "(Omitted: Sir,) it is lamentable that mass agricultural development is (Omitted: not) speeded by fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms."
