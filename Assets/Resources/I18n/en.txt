nightone.phoneguy.lineone=Hello? Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night.
nightone.phoneguy.linetwo=Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So,
nightone.phoneguy.linethree=I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about.
nightone.phoneguy.linefour=Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week, okay?
nightone.phoneguy.linefive=Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read.
nightone.phoneguy.linesix=Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, "Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.
nightone.phoneguy.lineseven=A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life.
nightone.phoneguy.lineheight=Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person.
nightone.phoneguy.linenine=Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon
nightone.phoneguy.lineten=property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced."
nightone.phoneguy.lineeleven=Blah, blah, blah. Now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about.
nightone.phoneguy.linetwelve=Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No.
nightone.phoneguy.linethirteen=If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath?
nightone.phoneguy.linefourteen=I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a
nightone.phoneguy.linefifteen=special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.
nightone.phoneguy.linesixteen=So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of
nightone.phoneguy.lineseventeen=free roaming mode at night. Uh... something about their servos locking up
nightone.phoneguy.lineeighteen=if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too.
nightone.phoneguy.linenineteen=But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?
nightone.phoneguy.linetwenty=Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any,
nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyone=is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person.
nightone.phoneguy.linetwentytwo=They'll pr- they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on.
nightone.phoneguy.linetwentythree=Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...
nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyfour=forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad
nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyfive=if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices,
nightone.phoneguy.linetwentysix=especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head
nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyseven=forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort... and death.
nightone.phoneguy.linetwentyheight=Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs
nightone.phoneguy.linetwentynine=and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.
nightone.phoneguy.linethirty=Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze.
nightone.phoneguy.linethirtyone=I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors
nightone.phoneguy.linethirtytwo=only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.
nighttwo.phoneguy.lineone=Uhh, Hello? Hello? Uh, well, if you're hearing this and you made it to day two, uh, congrats!
